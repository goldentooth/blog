# Clog (Changelog)

Basically just a journal of me working through creating and configuring and doing a bunch of stuff with my [Pi Bramble](https://goldentooth.net).

This isn't really as much a blog as it is just a series of notes to myself of what I've done, what I left undone, what I struggled with, etc. I would be delighted if it is of some use to other engineers or hobbyists. I don't know how likely that is, though.

You can read it at https://clog.goldentooth.net/ .

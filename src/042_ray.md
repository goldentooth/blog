# Ray

Finally, we're getting back to something that's associated directly with machine learning: [Ray](https://www.ray.io).

It would be normal to opt for [KubeRay](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html) here, since I am actually running Kubernetes on Goldentooth, but I'm not normal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Instead, I'll be going with the [on-prem approach](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/vms/user-guides/launching-clusters/on-premises.html#on-prem), which... has some implications.

First of these is that I need to install Conda on every node. This is fine and probably something I should've already done anyway, just as a normal matter of course. Except I kind of did as part of setting up [Slurm](./032_slurm.md). Which, yeah, probably means a refactor is in order.

So let's install and configure Conda, then setup a Ray cluster!

**TL;DR**: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.

So, that ended up being a major pain in the ass. The `conda-forge` channel didn't have builds of Ray for `aarch64`, so I needed to configure the `defaults` channel. Once the correct packages were installed, I encountered mysterious issues where the Ray dashboard wouldn't start up, causing the entire service to crash. It turned out, after prolonged debugging, that the Ray dashboard was apparently segfaulting because of issues with a `grpcio` wheel ‚Äì not sure if it was built improperly, or what.

After figuring that out, I managed to get the cluster up, but still encountered issues. Well, the cluster was running Ray 2.46.0, and my MBP was running 2.7.0, so... that checks out. Unfortunately, I was attempting to follow [MadeWithML](https://madewithml.com) based on a recommendation, and there were no Pi builds available for 2.7.0.

So I updated the MadeWithML project to use 2.46.0, brute-force-ishly, and that worked - for a time, but then incompatibilities started popping up. So I guess MadeWithML and my cluster weren't meant to be together.

Nevertheless, I _do_ have a somewhat functioning Ray cluster, so I'm going to call this a victory (the only one I can) and move on.
